## Javascript Lint review

Throughout development I used gulp and Js Hint for linting. Both returned no errors these warnings:

791	'default parameters' is only available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6')  
791	'arrow function syntax (=>)' is only available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6').

These relate to a short snippet of code borrowed from stack overflow which I used to implement a sorting function.

## Javascript Style Guide
I have followed W3 schools style guide along with the use of atom beautify to cover indentations.
